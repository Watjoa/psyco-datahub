# Data Access Policy

The Motivation & Crisis Data Hub follows a three-layer access model to balance open science with participant protection and ethical use.

## Layer 1 – Public Access

Open access is provided to:

- Study documentation and protocols  
- Codebooks and metadata  
- Aggregated statistics and dashboards  
- Synthetic datasets and analysis examples  

These materials are freely available and may be used for teaching, exploratory analyses, and methodological development, provided that the hub is properly cited.

## Layer 2 – Registered Access

Restricted, de-identified datasets are available on request to qualified researchers.

Requirements for access include:

- Submission of a brief project description  
- Evidence of ethical approval (where applicable)  
- Agreement to the terms outlined in the Data Use Agreement (DUA)  

Approved users will receive controlled access (e.g., private GitHub repository or secure download link) to a specific dataset version.

## Layer 3 – Internal Access

Full datasets, including highly detailed or sensitive variables, are only accessible to authorized members of the project consortium and are not distributed externally.

## Responsibilities of Data Users

All users of the restricted datasets agree to:

- Refrain from any attempt to re-identify participants  
- Store data securely and prevent unauthorized access  
- Not redistribute the data to third parties  
- Cite the dataset and relevant publications appropriately  
- Inform the project team of any manuscripts or reports based on the data  

Further details are specified in the Data Use Agreement provided upon approval.
