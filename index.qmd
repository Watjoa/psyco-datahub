# PsySoc Data Hub

> Welcome to the PsySoc Data Hub: the Psychology & Society Data Hub. This platform serves as a central repository for large-scale datasets on themes regarding psychology and society. <br><br>
The name PsySoc highlights the mission of the Data Hub: to bridge psychological science with societal topics by fostering collaboration across research domains, practitioners, and policy actors, an essential endeavour both in times of crisis and for society’s long-term resilience. <br><br>

## About

The **PsySoc Data Hub** brings together a growing collection of complementary datasets that offer insight into how people navigate societal challenges, adapt over time, and experience the conditions around them. It offers:

- 📊 **A growing collection of high-quality datasets** 
- 🧠 Documenting **central themes** such as motivation, need satisfaction and frustration, well-being, mental health, trust in institutions, adherence, and risk perception, along with the full catalogue of publications derived from these datasets.
- 🔍 **Comprehensive documentation**, including codebooks, protocols, methodological notes, and variable descriptions  
- 🛡️ **GDPR-compliant controlled access** for sensitive data  
- 🧪 **Synthetic datasets**, tutorials, and reproducible examples for learning and transparent analysis  

### Current datasets

#### Motivation Barometer & THRIVE Datasets  

At the heart of the hub lies the **Motivation Barometer**, a landmark monitoring project that followed the psychological functioning of the Belgian population from the earliest days of the COVID-19 crisis. Across more than 110 waves and over 320,000 participants, the project tracked motivation, psychological needs, risk perception, adherence, well-being, and trust.

The **THRIVE** project builds on this infrastructure, extending it beyond the pandemic with new longitudinal waves and additional qualitative and quantitative data. Together, these efforts create a rich, theory-driven resource for studying resilience, vulnerability, democratic attitudes, communication, and long-term recovery.

Both datasets are integrated into one cohesive data ecosystem, allowing researchers to seamlessly explore trends over time, compare modules, and link psychological indicators to societal developments.

#### Louvain Foundation Dataset  

The **Louvain Foundation** dataset follows more than 5000 UCLouvain students and Belgian residents across seven waves from 2021–2022, with a follow-up wave in 2025. It gives many information into COVID-19–related perceptions and behaviors (e.g., trust in health authorities, adherence to public health measures), alongside well-being, social connection, emotional responses, and other psychological indicators during and after the pandemic. Fully anonymized by design, it offers a secure and useful resource for research on the social and psychological impact of COVID-19.

## Using the Data

Once you have access to the synthetic or restricted data, you can work with it directly in R.  
Below is a minimal example showing how to load the data and inspect basic need variables:

For more advanced examples (longitudinal modelling, multilevel models, weighting, handling missing data), see:

- [Tutorials](tutorials/index.qmd)  
- [Analysis examples](tutorials/how_to_run_longitudinal_models.qmd)

---

## Versioning and Reproducibility

To ensure **transparency and reproducibility**, all datasets are:

- Released in clearly labeled **versions** (e.g., v1.0, v1.1)  
- Accompanied by **release notes** describing changes in variables, coding, or sample composition  
- Linked to **DOIs** for persistent citation  

Analysis scripts and Quarto documents are aligned with specific data versions, allowing users to reproduce published work and tutorial examples exactly.

## Citation

If you use the resources or data from this hub, please cite the specific dataset(s) and version(s) you relied on.  
An up-to-date citation format for each dataset is available on the [Citation & Acknowledgements](citation.qmd) page.
