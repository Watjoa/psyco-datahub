# PsySoc DataHub

> Welcome to the PsySoc DataHub: the Psychology & Society DataHub. <br><br>
This platform serves as a central repository for large-scale Belgian datasets on psychology and society, such as the Motivation Barometer and THRIVE projects, with additional datasets to be added over time. The name PsySoc highlights the mission of the DataHub: to bridge psychological science with societal needs by fostering collaboration across research domains, practitioners, and policy actors—an essential endeavour both in times of crisis and for society’s long-term resilience. <br><br>
The DataHub provides structured access to high-quality data on motivation, basic psychological needs, mental health, and responses to societal and public health measures, supported by comprehensive documentation and GDPR-compliant access procedures.

## About

The **PsySoc DataHub** brings together a growing collection of complementary datasets that offer insight into how people navigate societal challenges, adapt over time, and experience the conditions around them.  

### Current datasets

#### Motivation Barometer & THRIVE Datasets  

At the heart of the hub lies the **Motivation Barometer**, a landmark monitoring project that followed the psychological functioning of the Belgian population from the earliest days of the COVID-19 crisis. Across more than 110 waves and over 320,000 participants, the project tracked motivation, psychological needs, risk perception, adherence, well-being, and trust.

The **THRIVE** project builds on this infrastructure, extending it beyond the pandemic with new longitudinal waves and additional qualitative and quantitative data. Together, these efforts create a rich, theory-driven resource for studying resilience, vulnerability, democratic attitudes, communication, and long-term recovery.

#### Louvain Foundation Dataset

## Using the Data

Once you have access to the synthetic or restricted data, you can work with it directly in R.  
Below is a minimal example showing how to load the data and inspect basic need variables:

For more advanced examples (longitudinal modelling, multilevel models, weighting, handling missing data), see:

- [Tutorials](tutorials/index.qmd)  
- [Analysis examples](tutorials/how_to_run_longitudinal_models.qmd)

---

## Versioning and Reproducibility

To ensure **transparency and reproducibility**, all datasets are:

- Released in clearly labeled **versions** (e.g., v1.0, v1.1)  
- Accompanied by **release notes** describing changes in variables, coding, or sample composition  
- Linked to **DOIs** for persistent citation  

Analysis scripts and Quarto documents are aligned with specific data versions, allowing users to reproduce published work and tutorial examples exactly.

## Citation

If you use the resources or data from this hub, please cite the specific dataset(s) and version(s) you relied on.  
An up-to-date citation format for each dataset is available on the  
[Citation & Acknowledgements](citation.qmd) page.
