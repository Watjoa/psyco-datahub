# PsySoc Data Hub

> Welcome to the central data hub for the **Motivation Barometer** and **THRIVE** projects. <br> <br> An integrated repository hosting Belgian datasets that enable evidence-based research on motivation, basic psychological needs, mental health, and responses to public health measures, accompanied by comprehensive documentation and GDPR-compliant access procedures.

## About

The **PsySoc Data Hub** brings together two major, complementary datasets that offer unparalleled insight into how people navigate societal challenges, adapt over time, and experience the conditions around them.

#### Motivation Barometer & THRIVE Dataset  

At the heart of the hub lies the **Motivation Barometer**, a landmark monitoring project that followed the psychological functioning of the Belgian population from the earliest days of the COVID-19 crisis. Across more than 110 waves and over 320,000 participants, the project tracked motivation, psychological needs, risk perception, adherence, well-being, and trust.

The **THRIVE** project builds on this infrastructure, extending it beyond the pandemic with new longitudinal waves and additional qualitative and quantitative data. Together, these efforts create a rich, theory-driven dataset for studying resilience, vulnerability, democratic attitudes, communication, and long-term recovery.

#### Louvain Foundation Dataset

## What the Data Hub offers

- 📊 **Two high-quality datasets**
- 🧠 Documenting **central themes** such as motivation, need satisfaction and frustration, well-being, mental health, trust in institutions, adherence, and risk perception, along with the full catalogue of publications derived from these datasets.
- 🔍 **Comprehensive documentation**, including codebooks, protocols, methodological notes, and variable descriptions  
- 🛡️ **GDPR-compliant controlled access** for sensitive data  
- 🧪 **Synthetic datasets**, tutorials, and reproducible examples for learning and transparent analysis

## Three-layer access model

To safeguard privacy and ensure responsible use of the data, the hub follows a **three-layer access structure**:

### 🔓 Layer 1: Public Access

Openly available to everyone:

- Study documentation and protocols  
- Codebooks and variable lists  
- Aggregated statistics and interactive dashboards  
- Analysis scripts and tutorials  

Use this layer to:

- Explore what the projects are about  
- Understand the structure of the data  
- Teach and learn longitudinal analysis techniques

[View tutorials](tutorials/index.qmd){.btn .btn-outline}

---

### 📝 Layer 2: Registered Access

Restricted, de-identified versions of the real data are accessible **on request**.

Researchers can apply for access by submitting:

1. A brief project description (aims, research questions, planned analyses)  
2. Evidence of ethical approval (where applicable)  
3. An overview of the variables or modules needed  

Approved users will be asked to sign a **Data Use Agreement (DUA)**, which specifies:

- No re-identification attempts  
- No redistribution to third parties  
- Secure storage and responsible handling  
- Proper citation and acknowledgement of the datasets  

Access is granted via **private links** (e.g., private GitHub repo or secure download token) tied to a specific **dataset version**.

---

### 🔒 Layer 3: Internal Access

The full versions of the datasets (including detailed identifiers, extended demographics, and sensitive modules) are accessible only to authorized members of the **project consortium**.

These data:

- Are stored in **private repositories** with role-based permissions  
- Support ongoing longitudinal modelling, manuscript preparation, and consortium-driven projects  
- Are not shared externally without additional procedures

## Using the Data

Once you have access to the synthetic or restricted data, you can work with it directly in R.  
Below is a minimal example showing how to load the data and inspect basic need variables:



For more advanced examples (longitudinal modelling, multilevel models, weighting, handling missing data), see:

- [Tutorials](tutorials/index.qmd)  
- [Analysis examples](tutorials/how_to_run_longitudinal_models.qmd)

---

## Versioning and Reproducibility

To ensure **transparency and reproducibility**, all datasets are:

- Released in clearly labeled **versions** (e.g., v1.0, v1.1)  
- Accompanied by **release notes** describing changes in variables, coding, or sample composition  
- Linked to **DOIs** for persistent citation  

Analysis scripts and Quarto documents are aligned with specific data versions, allowing users to reproduce published work and tutorial examples exactly.
