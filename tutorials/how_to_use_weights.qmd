# Using Survey Weights

Some waves include survey weights to better approximate the Belgian population in terms of age, gender, education, and region.

This tutorial shows how to:

1. Specify a survey design object with weights.
2. Compute weighted estimates for key variables.

Always consult the documentation for each wave to understand how weights were constructed and when they should be used.
