The studies in this theme analyze the motivational, cognitive, and contextual factors that guide population-level engagement in preventive actions such as distancing, hygiene behaviors, and risk-responsive behavior.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        Trajectories of Health Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic:\n        A Longitudinal Analysis of Handwashing, Mask Wearing, Social Contact Limitations, and Physical Distancing\n      \n      \n        Wollast, R., Schmitz, M., Bigot, A., Speybroeck, N., de la Sablonnière, R., Lacourse, E., & Luminet, O.\n      \n      \n        Psychology & Health (2023), 39(13), 1899–1926\n      \n    \n\n    \n      Abstract\n\n      \n        This study aimed to investigate the associations between health behavior adherence and psychological factors during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on identifying trajectories of handwashing, mask wearing, social contact limitations, and physical distancing.\n      \n\n      \n       Aim: This study aimed to investigate the associations between health behavior adherence and psychological factors during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on identifying trajectories of handwashing, mask wearing, social contact limitations, and physical distancing. Methods: We employed a multi-trajectory group-based approach to analyze data from 6026 Belgian residents, including 60% women, with an average age of 52.65. Data were collected over six waves spanning from April 2021 to December 2021. Results: Participants were categorized into trajectory groups based on persistently low (11.9%), moderate-low (20.9%), moderate-high (39.1%), and high (28.1%) levels of adherence to the specified health behaviors. Our findings indicate a declining trend in health behavior adherence over the study period. Additionally, we observed that females, older individuals, and those with prior COVID-19 infection had a higher likelihood of belonging to trajectory groups characterized by the highest levels of health behavior adherence. Similarly, individuals with positive vaccination intentions, a heightened perception of consequences, and increased health anxiety demonstrated greater adherence to health behaviors over time. Furthermore, our investigation into the relationship between health behaviors and mental health revealed that participants in trajectory groups with higher levels of adherence to social contact limitations and physical distancing reported increased feelings of loneliness and decreased life satisfaction. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped our lives, and while vaccines have marked progress, maintaining health behaviors is crucial for virus prevention. To address potential mental health challenges from sanitary measures, policies and communication should promote health behaviors while acknowledging their psychological impact.\n      \n\n      Read more\n    \n\n    \n      Keywords\n      \n        Health behavior\n        COVID-19\n        Trajectories\n        Longitudinal\n        Prevention\n      \n    \n\n    \n      View article\n    \n  \n \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        Predicting Health Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study\n      \n      \n        Wollast, R., Schmitz, M., Bigot, A., Brisbois, M., & Luminet, O.\n      \n      \n        PLoS ONE (2024), 19(3), e0299868\n      \n    \n\n    \n      Abstract\n\n      \n        We investigated the social, emotional, and cognitive predictors of adherence to four health behaviors (handwashing, mask wearing, social contact limitations, and physical distancing) during one critical phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n      \n\n      \n        We investigated the social, emotional, and cognitive predictors of adherence to four health behaviors (handwashing, mask wearing, social contact limitations, and physical distancing) during one critical phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected data (N = 5803, mean age = 53; 57% women) in Belgium at five time points between April and July 2021, a time during which infections evolved from high (third wave of the pandemic) to low numbers of COVID-19 cases. The results show that the social, emotional, and cognitive predictors achieved high levels of explained variance (R2 &gt; .60). In particular, the central components of behavioral change (attitudes, intentions, control, habits, norms, and risk) were the strongest and most consistent predictors of health behaviors over time. Likewise, autonomous motivation and empathetic emotions (e.g., attentive, compassionate) had a positive impact on health behavior adherence, whereas it was the opposite for lively emotions (e.g., active, enthusiastic). These results offer policymakers actionable insights into the most potent and stable factors associated with health behaviors, equipping them with effective strategies to curtail the spread of future infectious diseases.\n      \n\n      Read more\n    \n\n    \n      Keywords\n      \n        Health behavior\n        COVID-19\n        Longitudinal\n        Predictors\n        Public health\n      \n    \n\n    \n      View article\n    \n  \n \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        Are There Three Subtypes of Social Distancing?

Aims: We propose that social distancing has three subtypes: physical distancing, social contact limitations, and emotional distancing. Method: To test this hypothesis, we employed a longitudinal design to analyze the trajectories of social distancing subtypes over a period of 8 months during the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 6,026). Three years after the main survey, we recontacted the same participants, asking whether they would be willing to re-adopt social distancing measures in the context of a new pandemic (N = 841). Results: First, using a confirmatory factor analysis, we demonstrated that these subtypes are related but distinct constructs. Second, using group-based trajectory modeling, we identified trajectories of individuals following persistently low, moderate-low, moderate-high, and high levels of social distancing subtypes over time. Trajectories of physical distancing and social contact limitations were highly similar and decreased over time, whereas trajectories of emotional distancing were significantly different from the other two subtypes and showed stability. Importantly, we found sociodemographic and mental health indicators distinguishing these trajectories. Finally, we found that emotional distancing exhibited a stronger and more consistent association with social contact limitations than with physical distancing across studies. Conclusion: This study proposes a refined taxonomy of social distancing, highlighting the distinct subtypes of physical distancing, social contact limitations, and emotional distancing (see items in the Appendix). This new taxonomy has been both conceptually and statistically validated in the present paper and can assist other experts in assessing the construct of social distancing more accurately in future studies.

Dispositional constructs (personality traits, generalized beliefs) are associated with health behaviors, but few studies test potential underlying mechanisms. The current study tested an integrated theoretical model specifying indirect effects of personality traits (conscientiousness, extraversion) and socio-political beliefs (trust in political leaders and health authorities) on initial participation, and subsequent trajectories, in COVID-19 preventive behaviors (handwashing, physical distancing, limiting social contact, mask wearing) mediated by social cognition constructs (attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control) and intentions. Methods. Belgian residents (N = 1762) completed measures of dispositional and social cognition constructs and intentions for COVID-19 preventive behaviors on an initial occasion and self-reported their engagement in the behaviors on four follow-up occasions from April to July 2021. Model predictions were tested using latent growth curve modeling. Results. Indirect positive effects of conscientiousness and trust in politicians and health authorities, and indirect negative effects of extraversion, on health behavior intentions and initial behavior participation as mediated through social cognition (with minor exceptions). These accounted for non-trivial variance in each outcome. Contrary to predictions, model constructs did not account for variance in behavioral trajectories. Conclusion. The current analysis lends support for the model across behaviors, adding to an evidence base of potentially malleable determinants of COVID-19 preventive actions and a candidate mechanism. How to sustain adherence to COVID-19 preventive actions remains an open question in need of further research.

In the present research, we employed a longitudinal design to identify loneliness trajectories within a period of twelve months during the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium (N = 2106). We were particularly interested in the potential protective role of self-compassion in these temporal dynamics. Using a group-based trajectory modelling approach, we identified trajectory groups of individuals following low (11.0%), moderate-low (22.4%), moderate (25.7%), moderate-high (31.3%), and high (9.6%) levels of loneliness. Findings indicated that younger people, women, and individuals with poor quality relationships, high levels of health anxiety, and stress related to COVID-19, all had a higher probability of belonging to the highest loneliness trajectory groups. Importantly, we also found that people high in two of the three facets of self-compassion (self-kindness and common humanity) had a lower probability of belonging to the highest loneliness trajectory groups. Ultimately, we demonstrated that trajectory groups reflecting higher levels of loneliness were associated with lower life satisfaction and greater depressive symptoms.

Existing evidence shows that COVID-19 is related to poor emotional well-being, particularly among women. However, most work on the subject uses single-country samples, limiting the ability to generalize the disparity or explain it as a function of societal variables. The present study investigates the expression of positive and negative emotions during the pandemic as a function of gender and across 24 countries (N = 49,637). Strong gender differences emerged across countries, with women reporting more negative emotions (anxious, depressed, nervous, exhausted) and less positive emotions (calm, content, relaxed, energetic) than men. The gender gap in positive emotions was significantly wider in countries higher in individualism and narrower in countries higher in power distance. For instance, differences in emotions were larger in Western countries high in individualism, such as the USA, the UK, Italy, and France, and smaller in countries with higher collectivism and power distance, such as China, Malaysia, and South Korea, with a few exceptions like Japan and Brazil. These gender differences across countries were not explained by country-level gender inequalities indicators (GGGI and GII). Interestingly, the national severity of the pandemic, an epidemiological factor, reduced gender differences in positive emotions. These results underscore the importance of considering cultural and national factors when assessing gender differences in well-being.\n      \n\n      Read more\n    \n\n    \n      Keywords\n      \n        Gender differences\n        Emotions\n        Gender inequality\n        Cultural values\n        COVID-19\n        Cross-national\n      \n    \n\n    \n      View article\n    \n  \n \n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        Adherence to COVID-19 Measures: The Critical Role of Autonomous Motivation on a Short- and Long-Term Basis\n      \n      \n        Morbée, S., Vermote, B., Waterschoot, J., Dieleman, L., Soenens, B., Van den Bergh, O., Ryan, R.

It offers:\n\n📊 A growing collection of high-quality datasets\n🧠 Documenting central themes such as motivation, need satisfaction and frustration, well-being, mental health, trust in institutions, adherence, and risk perception, along with the full catalogue of publications derived from these datasets.\n🔍 Comprehensive documentation, including codebooks, protocols, methodological notes, and variable descriptions\n\n🛡️ GDPR-compliant controlled access for sensitive data\n\n🧪 Synthetic datasets, tutorials, and reproducible examples for learning and transparent analysis\n\n\nCurrent datasets\n\nMotivation Barometer & THRIVE Datasets\nAt the heart of the hub lies the Motivation Barometer, a landmark monitoring project that followed the psychological functioning of the Belgian population from the earliest days of the COVID-19 crisis. Across more than 110 waves and over 320,000 participants, the project tracked motivation, psychological needs, risk perception, adherence, well-being, and trust.\nThe THRIVE project builds on this infrastructure, extending it beyond the pandemic with new longitudinal waves and additional qualitative and quantitative data. Together, these efforts create a rich, theory-driven resource for studying resilience, vulnerability, democratic attitudes, communication, and long-term recovery.\nBoth datasets are integrated into one cohesive data ecosystem, allowing researchers to seamlessly explore trends over time, compare modules, and link psychological indicators to societal developments.\n\n\nLouvain Foundation Dataset\nThe Louvain Foundation dataset follows more than 5000 UCLouvain students and Belgian residents across seven waves from 2021–2022, with a follow-up wave in 2025. It gives many information into COVID-19–related perceptions and behaviors (e.g., trust in health authorities, adherence to public health measures), alongside well-being, social connection, emotional responses, and other psychological indicators during and after the pandemic. Fully anonymized by design, it offers a secure and useful resource for research on the social and psychological impact of COVID-19.\nBrowse datasets"
